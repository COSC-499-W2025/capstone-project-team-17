# Capstone Team 7 Logs

## Week 3 (September 15 - 21)

We worked on developing ideas for the functional and non-functional requirements for the Project Requirements document. Additionally, we added information regarding the target user group and usage scenarios. We also spent time discussing the requirements in class and learning about other teams' requirements as well.
